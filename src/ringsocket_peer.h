// The worker threads' array of connected peers may need to be quite long, so
// each peer element should be made as compact as possible to minimize cache
// misses. Without compromizing semantic clarity, this is achieved as follows:
//
// * Member types are as small as they can be proven to be safe, unless
//   alignment requirements allow them extra space that would otherwise lead to
//   padding below that member.
// * Small types are grouped in pairs such that their combined size matches the
//   alignment of their adjacent member recursively, up to 64-bit "blocks".
// * Union usage allows space sharing between variables that have mutually
//   exclusive lifetimes. E.g., HTTP parsing vs WebSocket parsing.
// * A union as member of a top level struct would have a size larger than the
//   maximum simple type size of 8 bytes, leading to unnecessary padding in that
//   top-level struct. Because of that, rs_peer is instead implemented as a
//   top-level union of equally sized structs.
// * Clean namespacing: full-lifetime shared member variables are placed in a
//   C11 anonymous struct to avoid confusion with layer/phase-specific .http and
//   .ws struct members and vice versa.
// * To prevent member overlap with the shared anonymous struct members, each
//   struct contains an anonymous "phony bit flag" placeholder of the right size
//   and position to achieve said alignment.
// * A C11 static_assert(sizeof(union rs_peer) == 40) call makes sure everything
//   is packed by the compiler as intended.
