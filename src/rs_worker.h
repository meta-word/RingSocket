// # union rs_peer & Co. #######################################################

// The worker threads' array of connected peers may need to be quite long, so
// each peer element should be made as compact as possible to minimize cache
// misses, which is why rs_peer is implemented as follows:
//
// * Member types are as small as they can be proven to be safe (unless
//   alignment requirements allow them extra space that would otherwise lead to
//   padding below that member).
// * Small types are grouped in pairs such that their combined size matches the
//   alignment of their adjacent member recursively, up to 64-bit "blocks".
// * Union usage allows space sharing between variables that have mutually
//   exclusive lifetimes. E.g., HTTP parsing vs WebSocket parsing.
// * A union as member of a top level struct would have a size larger than the
//   maximum simple type size of 8 bytes, leading to unnecessary padding in that
//   top-level struct. Because of that, rs_peer is instead implemented as a
//   top-level union of equally sized structs.
// * Clean namespacing: full-lifetime shared member variables are placed in a
//   C11 anonymous struct to avoid confusion with layer-specific .http and .ws
//   struct members, and vice versa.
// * To prevent member overlap with the shared anonymous struct members, each
//   struct contains an anonymous "phony bit flag" placeholder of the right size
//   and position to achieve the desired alignment.
// * C11 static_assert(sizeof(X) == Y) assertions in rs_worker.c make sure
//   everything is packed by as intended in a standard-compliant way.
